I got an issue regarding redirecting the login page to the dashboard. I called the " /api/user/login " API and get the token. but it can't pass to the dashboard because of the above issue. then, I use the refresh function to go to the Dashboard page. In the event of a refresh,  fetched "token" value has removed. After I hard code token value in the "dashboard.js" page under the "token" property. please get the latest token value using this link=>(http://apps.avantrio.xyz:8010/api/user/login ) and add it to the "token" property. then you can view my other functionality. if you have any issue please contact me directly.
